            		<p>Based in the heart of Dublin Patrick Farrell Physiotherapy Clinic has been operating since 1998 with a dedicated team of physiotherapists each with their specialist field. The Clinic can cater for all types of physio care, from sports injury rehabilatation, orthotics, ergonomics, acupuncture and treatment for osteoporosis.</p>
                	<p>All of our Physiotherapists are Chartered, which means they are either Members of the Irish regulatory body for Physiotherapy – the ISCP, or the UK regulatory body for Physiotherapy –  the CSP. Our physios regularly partake in internal and recognised external professional development courses to further their knowledge, expand their skill set and expertise, and meet training guidelines set down by The Physio Company.</p>
                	<h4>Our Promise</h4>
                	<p>First and foremost, we will work hard to get you better but just as importantly we strive to make your visit as enjoyable as possible. We have created some service promises that allow you to confidently "choose Patrick Farrell Physiotherapy Clinc" knowing that you will receive the best treatment and the best service possible.</p>
                	<h4><em>Be Confident You're in Good Hands</em></h4>
                	<p>We know that Ireland is full of people who "claim" to be able to help you. We only employ fully qualified, licensed and insured Chartered Physiotherapists. Your body is important so we are careful who we offer to help you.</p>
                	<h4><em>No Waiting Around</em></h4>
                	<p>Whilst 95% of treatments will start on time, we guarantee that you will never be kept waiting longer than 15 minutes. We know that you are too busy to wait around. If we do not meet this, then you decide whether you want to pay us – no questions asked.</p>
                	<h4><em>No Technical Jargon</em></h4>
                	<p>After seeing us you will know your problem and solutions in language that you understand. We will not scare you with medical terminology but instead help you understand.</p>
                	<h4><em>No More Unknown</em></h4>
                	<p>Ever had a problem treated only for it to keep reoccurring? We strive to tell you Day 1 what you can expect with respect to correcting the primary cause of your pain and then achieving a lasting solution to your problem.

These promises are not written to fill up pages on the site… but rather
These are the guiding principles of our business, ensuring that we make your treatments as fast, smooth, comfortable and of course SUCCESSFUL as possible.</p>
