            	<p class="test"><em>"Thank you again so much for everything you did for me. I couldn't have done it without you"</em></p>
                <p>Conor Lyne - Winter Olympian 2014</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"I spent 20 weeks with Patrick Farrell a couple of years ago after snapping my achilles tendon and tearing all the ligaments in my foot/ankle in a climbing accident. He got me back climbing and now mountain biking. The important thing as they will point out is to follow the program of exercises to the letter, your recovery is in your own hands."</em></p>
                <p>Kevin - Smithfield, Dublin 2</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"I'd always consult a physio/ physical therapist to accelerate the recovery time. Patrick Farrell has a fantastic rep. Been to him myself and quite a few of my running and cycling buddies have."</em><p>
                <p>Rob - Newbridge, Kildare</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"My most sincere thanks & gratitude to Patrick Farrel for his wonderful professional care & dedication. After only a few visits to Patrick I am recovering very well from a very severe long standing hip pain & bad limp. I never expected to make this progress , Patrick, you are truly Miraculous!"</em></p>
                <p>Vicki McGrath - Dublin</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"Top quality and skilled service – my knee is brand new thanks to these guys!"</em></p>
                <p>Alan - Rathmines, Dublin</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"My sincere thanks to Emma Jones for all the help she has given me to alleviate a long standing problem. After visiting Emma only a few times I finally feel I am getting some relief from these symtoms, which I had given up hope of ever having. I have to say that Emma is very thorough, professional and I will be recommending her to all my friends."</em></p>
                <p>LR - Dublin</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"I am an avid cyclist and overall sporty person and came to Patrick Farrell Physiotheraoy to see Niamh Boland a year after a cycling accident. After a misdiagnosis which I got treated on for a year I came here based on a recommendation. I was in a desperate state with ongoing lower back pain which hindered all my sporting activites and every day life. Within just a few visits, a tailored exercise plan and some acupuncture I feel a million times better and overall pain free. I still come here for maintenance. I’m feeling very grateful. Thanks!"</em></p>
                <p>Nicole - Ashburn, Meath</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"Just to say thank you very much Dominic for all your help and hard work, much appreciated. I hope I don’t need your services again, but I won’t hesitate in coming back to you if I have any problems in future."</em></p>
                <p>Tom - Dublin</p>
                <p class="test"><em>"I attended Robert Nolan on the recommendation of my surgeon following a long history of back and neck issues. I found all at the clinic extremely friendly, helpful and relaxed. Not only did Robert help me immensely, I now have a rehab programme and no longer need to attend on a regular basis!!"</em></p>
